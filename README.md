Mobile programming midterm project

Team: Dualcore (Filippo Maria Briscese, Davide Ilardi)



This project shows how some Android sensors works, we also presented a lecture in class to our colleagues, you can find here our lecture slides.

We also developed some simple applications with sensors to show their potential:

- Compass
- Telephone call simulator
- Light Saber

For the compass and call simulator you can find some code snippets in the slides.
